          Hello, my name is Great Joseph, and I am currently a student at
          Brigham Young University - Idaho (BYU-Idaho), where I am pursuing a
          degree in Web Design and Development. I am thrilled to be on this
          academic journey because web development and design are fields that
          constantly evolve, offering endless opportunities for creativity and
          technical growth. These areas of study not only allow me to combine my
          love for technology with my creative side but also empower me to solve
          problems in innovative ways. From an early age, Iâ€™ve been fascinated
          by the idea of how the internet connects people and makes information
          accessible worldwide. This curiosity eventually led me to pursue web
          development, as I realized how impactful a well-designed website could
          be for communication, business, and education.
